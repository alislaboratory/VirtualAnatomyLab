# Redirect all requests to Node.js application
# This is for cPanel Node.js apps
# The Node.js Selector will handle routing, but this helps with static files

# Enable rewrite engine
RewriteEngine On

# If the file exists, serve it directly
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d

# For Node.js apps, cPanel handles routing automatically
# This file may not be needed if using cPanel Node.js Selector
